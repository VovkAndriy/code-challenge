# Scoreboard API Service Documentation

## Overview

The Scoreboard API Service is responsible for managing and updating the scoreboard, which displays the top 10 user scores on our website. The module ensures real-time updates, handles incoming score updates securely, and prevents unauthorized score manipulation.

## WebSocket Integration

### 1. Update Score via WebSocket

-   **Endpoint**: `wss://yourserver.com/score`
-   **Description**: Allows users to perform an action that increases their score in real-time.
-   **Connection**:
    -   Method: WebSocket (Bidirectional communication)
    -   Connection URL: `wss://yourserver.com/score`

#### Messages

-   **Action Message**:
    -   Description: Sent by the client to perform an action that affects the user's score.
    -   Format:
        ```
        {
          "action": "string",
          "user_id": "string",
          "details": {
            // Additional details about the action
          }
        } 
        ```
        
-   **Score Update Response**:
    -   Description: Sent by the server to notify the client of the updated score.
    -   Format:
        ```
        {
          "user_id": "string",
          "new_score": "integer"
        }
        ```
        
-   **Error Response**:
    -   Description: Sent by the server if there is an issue processing the action.
    -   Format:
        
        ```
        {
          "error": "string",
          "message": "string"
        }
        ```

### 2. Get Top Scores via WebSocket

-   **Endpoint**: `wss://yourserver.com/top-scores`
-   **Description**: Allows clients to request the top 10 user scores in real-time.
-   **Connection**:
    -   Method: WebSocket (Bidirectional communication)
    -   Connection URL: `wss://yourserver.com/top-scores`

#### Messages

-   **Request for Top Scores**:
    -   Description: Sent by the client to request the top scores.
    -   Format:
        
        ```
        {
          "request": "top_scores"
        }
        ```
        
-   **Top Scores Response**:
    -   Description: Sent by the server with the top 10 user scores.
    -   Format:
        ```
        [
          {
            "user_id": "string",
            "score": "integer"
          },
          ...
        ]
        ```
        
-   **Error Response**:
    -   Description: Sent by the server if there is an issue processing the request.
    -   Format:
        
        ```
        {
          "error": "string",
          "message": "string"
        }
        ```

## Security

1.  **Authentication:** All websockets must require authentication via a bearer token (JWT or API key). This ensures that only authorized clients can make requests.
2.  **Authorization:** Ensure that only users with appropriate permissions can update scores. This could involve verifying that the user making the request is authorized to update the score.
3.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. For example, limit the number of score updates per minute from a single user or IP address.
4.  **Input Validation:** Validate the `user_id` and `score` fields to ensure they meet expected formats and ranges. Reject requests with invalid or malicious input.
5.  **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging for all score update requests. Monitor for unusual activity that might indicate an attempt to exploit the system.

## Flow of Execution

1.  **Client** initiates a request to update the score or fetch top scores.
2.  **Authentication** ensures that the request is from an authorized source.
3.  **For score updates**:
    - Update Score: API validates the request and updates the database.
    - Update Database: reflects the new score.
    - Notify WebSocket: pushes the update to the WebSocket server.
4.  **WebSocket Server** broadcasts the update to connected clients.
5.  **Frontend** receives updates via WebSocket and refreshes the scoreboard.

## Additional Comments

1.  **Testing:** Ensure thorough testing of both security features (e.g., authentication, authorization) and functional aspects (e.g., correct score updates, accurate top 10 display).
2.  **Scalability:** Consider the scalability of the WebSocket server and database, especially under high load, to ensure the system performs well in production.
3.  **Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a fallback mechanism if the WebSocket server fails, such as periodic polling of the top scores endpoint.
